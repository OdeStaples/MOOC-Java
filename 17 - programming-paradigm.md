# Programming Paradigm

- A programming paradigm is a way of thinking about and structuring a program's functionality.

- The most common programming paradigms today are object-oriented programming, procedural programming, and functional programming.

# Object Oriented Programming

- In object-oriented programming, information is represented as classes that describe the concepts of the problem domain and the logic of the application.

- Classes define the methods that determine how information is handled. During program execution, objects are instantiated from classes that contain runtime information and that also have an effect on program execution: program execution typically proceeds through a series of method calls related to the objects. As mentioned a few weeks ago, "the program is built from small, clear, and cooperative entities."

- However, object-oriented programming is not inherently suited to all problems: for example, scientific computing and statistics applications typically make use of languages, such as R and Python.

# Procedural programming

- In procedural programming, the structure of the program is formed by functionality desired for the program: the program acts as a step-by-step guide for the functionality to be performed. The program is executed one step at a time, and subroutines (methods) are called whenever necessary.
