# Learning object-oriented programming

- Object-oriented programming is primarily about isolating concepts into their own entities or, in other words, creating abstractions.

- The great idea behind ​​object-oriented programming: a program is built from small and distinct objects that work together.

# Object

- An **Object** refers to an independent entity that contains both data (instance variables) and behavior (methods). Objects may come in lots of different forms: some may describe problem-domain concepts, others are used to coordinate the interaction that happens between objects. Objects interact with one another through method calls — these method calls are used to both request information from objects and give instructions to them.

- A **class** contains the blueprint needed to create objects, and also defines the objects' variables and methods. An object is created on the basis of the class constructor.

# Class

- A class defines the types of objects that can be created from it. It contains instance variables describing the object's data, a constructor or constructors used to create it, and methods that define its behavior.

- Objects are created from the class through constructors by using the `new` command.
